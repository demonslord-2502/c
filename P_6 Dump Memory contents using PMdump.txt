Dump Memory contents using PMdump

1.	
Here we will use program name mempass, and we will see how by using combination of pmdump and strings, we are able to dump the password in memory.
Let start the mempass
  

2.	
Now open new terminal and run PMdump, pmdump â€“list will list the running program currently.
 
 
3.	
Here we can see the pid of mempass i.e., 3456. We will dump the entire memory of mempass program in paswd.txt file
 
4.	
File name paswd is created having direct memory of mempass program without tampering the running mempass program
              
In this way, we can retrieve passwords from applications which store them in memory without any form of encryption.
