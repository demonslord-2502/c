==>
1]
Autopsy     Welcome     window     will appear    along    with    Autopsy     main window   in the      background.  In    the   Welcome   window, click New Case.

Select Type     of    Data Source to Add. In  this   lab, we  will  be  analyzing     a  disk image;  therefore,            select  the option  "Disk Image or VM File "  and  click  Next.

3]
A   window (named      Open) will appear     where you   need to   specify    the forensic image.   Navigate to  
C:\CHFI-Tools\Evidence Files\Forensic Images, select Linux_Evidence_001.img  and   click  Open.

4]
The   Add   Data   Source     window    now    displays the    Configure     Ingest       Modules section, which     contains     lists      of   options      that     are   checked.       Select   the     options according    to   your requirement       and   click    Next.

The application now   displays the result in the    Autopsy      main window.  Expand the      Data      Sources         node    in    the    left       pane     and     click      on   the    image       file    i.e.,Linux_Evidence_001.img. This    will show   the    contents     of the image    file, as shown   in the following   screenshot:

You may examine all the required     files    stored    in    the   image     as   a part    of filesystem         analysis. In    this    lab, we are   going     to     view    the     passwd   file    that    is stored   in \etc   location. Therefore, select the    etc folder    from    the left    pane.
Upon      selecting         the     folder, all   the     files      and    folders           present       in      etc     are     displayed in the right pane of the window.
Scroll down    the window, select    the     passwd file and click the Text tab.
Autopsy     displays    all   the    text (user     account    information) present    in    the passwd       file, under the Strings tab, 
as  shown  in    the    following  screenshot:

To study fsstat
To view    partition     tables    associated      with     Windows_Evidence_002.dd, type          mmls      "C:\CHFI-Tools\EvidenceFiles\ForensicImages\Windows_Evidence_002.dd"and   press    Enter.     This   displays    the partition           layout           of    a    volume          system (partition tables) associated with the image file, as shown in the following       screenshot:
 
cmd > the sleuth kit(TSK)\bin > mmls......

Similarly, to view the type of file system and the OS related to the image, type fsstat "C:\CHFI-Tools\Evidence Files\Forensic Images\Windows_Evidence_001.dd"and then press Enter.

10]
From the above screenshot, it can be observed that the file system is NTFS and the source      OS is Windows XP

To Study img_stat

Use the img_stat command to view the details of the selected image. Type img_stat"C:\CHFI-Tools\Evidence Files\Forensic Images\Windows_Evidence_001.dd"and press Enter to view   the details.

11]
To Study istat
Use the istat tool in The Sleuth Kit to view the details of metadata structure. To display an     overview of the MFT file, type   istat   -f   ntfs "C:\CHFI-Tools\Evidence Files\Forensic Images\Windows_Evidence_001.dd" 0 and press Enter to view   the details.

12]
To Study istat
Use the istat tool in The Sleuth Kit to view the details of metadata structure. To display an     overview of the MFT file, type   istat   -f   ntfs "C:\CHFI-Tools\Evidence Files\Forensic Images\Windows_Evidence_001.dd" 0 and press Enter to view   the details.

13]
To Study fls
Use the fls command-line tool of TSK to list the files and directory names.  Type fls -f  ntfs        "C:\CHFI-Tools\EvidenceFiles\ForensicImages\Windows_Evidence_001.dd"and then     press   Enter.
